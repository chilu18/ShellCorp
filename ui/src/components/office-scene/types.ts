/**
 * OFFICE SCENE TYPES
 * ==================
 * Shared types for the office scene composition modules.
 *
 * KEY CONCEPTS:
 * - Keep the public scene props stable while internal modules split by responsibility.
 * - Scene internals should import shared contracts from here instead of redefining them.
 *
 * USAGE:
 * - Import `OfficeSceneProps` from the public scene shell and internal scene modules.
 *
 * MEMORY REFERENCES:
 * - MEM-0143
