# Office System

> **Feature Status**: Active
> **Last Updated**: Dec 2025

## Overview

The Office System provides the 3D office environment where employees, teams, and furniture are rendered and interactable. It includes employee visualization, object interaction, and agent management UI.

## Core Components

### Object UI Bindings And Builder Panels ✅

**Status**: Complete (Mar 2026)

Office objects can now carry metadata-driven runtime UI bindings while keeping builder-only transform/config controls separate from normal scene interactions.

**Behavior**:

- **Builder mode**:
  - Furniture/custom objects expose radial controls for move, rotate, resize, delete, and settings
  - Settings open the Object Builder panel for embed configuration
- **Normal mode**:
  - Builder controls are hidden for office objects
  - Configured objects open a routed runtime panel instead of the radial menu
- **Embeds first**:
  - Runtime panel supports iframe-backed embeds with an external-open fallback for blocked sites
  - Metadata contract reserves future `skillBinding` support without changing the persistence shape

**Key Files**:

- **`office-object-ui.ts`**: typed metadata helpers for `uiBinding` and future `skillBinding`
- **`components/object-config-panel.tsx`**: builder-only embed configuration panel
- **`components/object-interaction-panel.tsx`**: runtime object panel/iframe viewer
- **`components/interactive-object.tsx`**: builder gating, runtime click routing, persisted scaling

### Interactive Object System ✅

**Status**: Complete (Nov 22, 2025)

Unified system for furniture and interactive objects in the 3D office.

**Architecture**:

- **`DraggableController`** (`controllers/draggable-controller.ts`): Pure TypeScript class for drag logic
  - Handles raycasting, grid snapping, event management
  - Testable without React
- **`InteractiveObject`** (`components/interactive-object.tsx`): Unified component for furniture/objects
  - Selection, hover, drag, context menu, DB sync
  - Uses DraggableController for drag operations
- **Employee Pattern**: Employees use `ContextMenu` directly (local selection state, no wrapper needed)

**Results**: 822 lines across 4 files → ~390 lines across 2 files (53% reduction)

**Deleted Files**:

- ❌ `draggable-object.tsx` (357 lines)
- ❌ `selectable-wrapper.tsx` (145 lines)
- ❌ `use-drag-drop.ts` (320 lines)
- ❌ `selection-store.ts` (23 lines)

See `.docs/REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md` for full details.

### Employee Hover Labels & Team Directory ✅

**Status**: Complete

Added hover labels to employees (similar to teams) and created a Team Directory page accessible from the global speed-dial menu.

**Features**:

- **Employee Hover Labels**: Employees show labels on hover displaying name, job title, and team name
- **Highlighted Employees**: Enhanced styling with ring effect and blue arrow indicator
- **Team Directory Component** (`components/hud/team-directory.tsx`):
  - Search functionality: filter by name, job title, or team
  - Grouped by team for better organization
  - Employee cards show: name, job title, team, CEO badge
  - "Locate" button highlights employee in 3D scene
- **Employee Highlighting System**:
  - Added `highlightedEmployeeId` to app store
  - Highlighted employees show enhanced label with primary color ring
  - Auto-clears after 5 seconds
- **Speed-Dial Integration**: Added "Team Directory" option to global speed-dial menu

**Technical Details**:

- Uses `Html` component from `@react-three/drei` for 3D text overlay
- Employee component receives `jobTitle` and `team` props
- Label positioned above employee using `TOTAL_HEIGHT + 0.5`

**Future Enhancements**:

- [ ] Add camera focus animation when locating employee
- [ ] Add employee status indicators in directory
- [ ] Add filters (by team, by status, etc.)
- [ ] Add employee detail view on click

### Agent Management UI ✅

**Status**: Complete (Nov 22, 2025)

Dashboard-style agent management UI for configuring employee agents.

**Component**: `components/manage-agent-dialog.tsx`

**Features**:

- **Overview Tab**: Employee stats and info
- **Tools Tab**: Multi-select tool configuration
- **Skills Tab**: Multi-select skill configuration
- **Prompt Tab**: System prompt editor

**Integration**:

- "Manage" button in employee context menu opens dialog
- Dialog state managed in `app-store.ts`
- Wired through `office/page.tsx`
- Employees link to agent configs via `agentConfigId` field

**Backend Integration**:

- Uses OpenClaw gateway + `openclaw-adapter` for CRUD operations
- Links to `toolConfigs` and `skillConfigs` for configuration
- Auto-creates default config if missing when chatting
