## Job To Be Done

When a small team runs many autonomous agents on one VPS, they need a single office control center that makes sessions, teams, memory, skills, and autonomy loops easy to inspect and steer without rebuilding the runtime.

## Product Direction

ShellCorp is UI-first:

- OpenClaw owns runtime, sessions, routing, and plugin lifecycle.
- ShellCorp maps OpenClaw state into a gamified office UI.
- Team and office operations are CLI-first in this phase.
- Extensions stay plugin-first (starting with Notion comments hooks).

## Current Product Value

- Office personalization and decoration controls for operators.
- Team topology, role demand, KPI/goal shaping, and heartbeat controls.
- Observability across team state, agent memory, and federated Kanban sync health.
- Team/agent timeline visibility backed by Convex event streams (`teamId` + `projectId` scope).
- Explicit operator governance for autonomy loops (pause/resume/manual run).

- `docs/feature-decorations.md`
- `docs/feature-cli.md`
- `docs/feature-business-logic.md`
- `docs/extensions.md`

## Scope Boundaries

In scope now:

- UI + adapter mapping on top of OpenClaw.
- CLI-first team and office operations (`npm run shell -- ...`).
- Canonical-provider-per-project federation baseline (`internal`/`notion`/`vibe`).
- Notion comments-first webhook integration via OpenClaw hooks.

Out of scope now:

- Rebuilding a custom runtime/gateway that duplicates OpenClaw.
- Full multi-master board writes with implicit conflict resolution.
- Hiding canonical provider ownership semantics.

## Behavioral Invariants

- OpenClaw is source-of-truth for runtime and sessions (`MEM-0100`).
- Team/org metadata lives in sidecar JSON (`MEM-0104`).
- Navigation is panel-first and parity-critical flows remain dedicated modal-based (`MEM-0107`, `MEM-0109`).
- Ticket lifecycle maps to session lifecycle until explicit close/reopen (`MEM-0112`).
- Team and office management remain CLI-first in current phase (`MEM-0119`, `MEM-0120`).
- Team timeline/audit logs are first-class by `teamId` in Convex writes and queries (`MEM-0132`).

## Recent Changes

- Added AI office UI QA runbook (`MEM-0118`).
- Added CEO Team Management CLI and docs-only SCL cookbook (`MEM-0119`).
- Added Office Decoration CLI and meshy-based spec generation workflow (`MEM-0120`).
